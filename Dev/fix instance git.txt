In Vertex AI Workbench Instances I somes times find an issue with the Git plugin.

Issue:
When I try to stage a commit it will not add to the staged queue. I tried:
- hovering on the file in the changed queue and click the '+'. 
- right clicking the file in the changed queue and click '+ Stage'
- using a terminal to stage with 'git add filename'

This issue is exposed with the terminal method:
- fatal: Unable to create '/home/jupyter/vertex-ai-mlops/.git/index.lock': File exists.

To Troublshoot I did these:
- cd to the main folder of the git repository
- run: ls -a .git
- notice that index.lock does exists
- run: cat .git/index.lock
- notice that the file is empty
- run: rm .git/index.lock
- try to stage the file again, succesful
